This is one of two Pre-Loaders that I made for an assignment that was given in my MDIA 2292 class. I liked the idea of having a black-and-white styled in-and-out loading bar themed pre-loader so that it keeps the idea of a simple loading screen in place. Though is is something that I may or may not use in the future, I still like the idea of this kind of pre-loader where its colours are simple, as well as the design of it
